Keisha is the creator of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openmictech.com/">Open Mic Tech</a>, a quarterly community-driven event designed to facilitate communication among professionals, students, and hobbyists in tech-related fields. OMT is a place for people to come together and talk about the stuff they're working on. Just as the name suggests, it's an open mic night geared toward technology.

At each event, members of the community are invited to share, through 5-15 minute lightning talks, some way that they're using technology. These talks aren't just for coders, but for anyone that uses tech in their lives.

Each event happens the second Tuesday of every quarter at the Goodwood Library and is free an open to the public. If the event interests you, consider coming to talk or to listen!
