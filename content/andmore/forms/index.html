<p>Does this seem familiar? You're at the doctor's office and are ready to get treatment for what ails you, but are given a stack of forms to fill out and return to the receptionist. You fill out page after page, scratching out any errors along the way as you write in the too-small spaces provided.</p>
<p>Perhaps there's a way to have had your forms filled out, not by hand, but by typing into a form that you downloaded before you even got to the doctor's office. If provide a service that does just that.</p>
<p>The forms I create can be emailed to patients at the time of their appointment for the patient to fill out and email back. Or, the patient still want to print and write the forms. Because these are interactive PDFs, none of the functionality of the paper form is lost.</p>
<p>Are you a medical professional that would benefit from these forms? Would you like to try out a sample? {{< resource url="sampleform.pdf" target="blank" text="Click here to try out the sample form" >}}.</p>Forms can even be signed using Adobe Acrobat.
