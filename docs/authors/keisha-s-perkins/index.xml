      <description>At the second Open Mic Tech, I spoke about how learning to automate tasks is the same as learning to program. In the talk, I introduce some automation apps that make a great foray into automation, and therefore, programming.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re in the age of STEM right now and everyone is screaming that &amp;ldquo;Everyone should learn to code&amp;rdquo; when what they really mean is that more people should learn how to program. Programming is a skill that will help most of us, as most of us deal with computers on a daily basis. Programmatic Thinking is a skill that will help almost anyone, because programmitic thinking is just problem solving in a systematic way.</description>

      <description>Keisha is the creator of Open Mic Tech, a quarterly community-driven event designed to facilitate communication among professionals, students, and hobbyists in tech-related fields. OMT is a place for people to come together and talk about the stuff they&amp;rsquo;re working on. Just as the name suggests, it&amp;rsquo;s an open mic night geared toward technology.
At each event, members of the community are invited to share, through 5-15 minute lightning talks, some way that they&amp;rsquo;re using technology.</description>

      <description>I create a good deal of media for my church, and sometimes that media needs to be used in many ways. Perhaps the event flier that I create for a pre-service loop of slides needs to also be made to fit social media, or be printed and handed out.
Up until recently I solved this issue by first designing something for the church&amp;rsquo;s presentation screen at a 16:9 ratio, then resizing and tweaking the design to meet whatever other needs where given to me.</description>

      <title>The Powerful Illustrator Shape Builder Tool</title>

      <description>When I began to foray into Adobe&amp;rsquo;s Creative Suite, I was using Photoshop for everything. Need a logo for lots of uses? Just deliver a huge PNG! Want to draw a nice crisp illustration? Photoshop&amp;rsquo;s pen tool works just fine for that, right?
Photoshop was my one-stop for everything I needed, though none of what I needed was what Photoshop was created for. It was some time before I even considered using any of Adobe&amp;rsquo;s many great pieces of software that actually suited my needs, like Illustrator.</description>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that all of us have at one time or another needed to get a job done on a small&amp;ndash;or sometimes non-existent&amp;ndash;budget. At times like these, we scour the web for quality free and cheap design assets. This post will share my favorite sources for free assets. They&amp;rsquo;re in no particular order, but I think they&amp;rsquo;re all pretty cool.

      <description>This talk is about using JavaScript to create games on the HTML5 canvas. Though you won’t create the next Halo, you’ll learn so much about JavaScript and programming as a whole when you create games with it. In this talk, I’ll introduce you to a library that’s perfect for beginners and “non-coders” alike called p5.js.
Why JavaScript? JavaScript is everywhere. If you use the internet, you’ve almost certainly encountered JavaScript.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a great static site generator that&#39;s super fast and lightweight. This talk demos the steps for getting a site up and running, adding a few posts, and choosing a theme. I really recommend digging into the HUGO docs as well as the HUGO Community Forum for more in-depth explanations of how to use HUGO for your own site.
There&#39;s also a great HUGO Tutorial Playlist by Mike Dane of the Giraffe Academy YouTube channel.</description>
