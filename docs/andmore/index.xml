      <description>Keisha is the creator of Open Mic Tech, a quarterly community-driven event designed to facilitate communication among professionals, students, and hobbyists in tech-related fields. OMT is a place for people to come together and talk about the stuff they&amp;rsquo;re working on. Just as the name suggests, it&amp;rsquo;s an open mic night geared toward technology.
At each event, members of the community are invited to share, through 5-15 minute lightning talks, some way that they&amp;rsquo;re using technology.</description>
