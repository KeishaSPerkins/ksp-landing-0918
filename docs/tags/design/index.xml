      <description>I create a good deal of media for my church, and sometimes that media needs to be used in many ways. Perhaps the event flier that I create for a pre-service loop of slides needs to also be made to fit social media, or be printed and handed out.
Up until recently I solved this issue by first designing something for the church&amp;rsquo;s presentation screen at a 16:9 ratio, then resizing and tweaking the design to meet whatever other needs where given to me.</description>
