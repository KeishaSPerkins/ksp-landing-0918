      <description>I create a good deal of media for my church, and sometimes that media needs to be used in many ways. Perhaps the event flier that I create for a pre-service loop of slides needs to also be made to fit social media, or be printed and handed out.
Up until recently I solved this issue by first designing something for the church&amp;rsquo;s presentation screen at a 16:9 ratio, then resizing and tweaking the design to meet whatever other needs where given to me.</description>

      <description>When I began to foray into Adobe&amp;rsquo;s Creative Suite, I was using Photoshop for everything. Need a logo for lots of uses? Just deliver a huge PNG! Want to draw a nice crisp illustration? Photoshop&amp;rsquo;s pen tool works just fine for that, right?
Photoshop was my one-stop for everything I needed, though none of what I needed was what Photoshop was created for. It was some time before I even considered using any of Adobe&amp;rsquo;s many great pieces of software that actually suited my needs, like Illustrator.</description>
